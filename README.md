JGI-SIH — MASTER PROTOTYPE GENERATION PROMPT

I have uploaded the complete project documentation for my JSPM Group Internal Smart India Hackathon (JGI-SIH) Portal.

IMPORTANT — READ THE DOCUMENT FIRST

Before generating any UI or code, read and understand the entire uploaded documentation carefully.

The uploaded documentation is the primary source of truth for this project.

Extract and understand:

Project objective

Problem being solved

Target users

User roles

Complete workflow

AI modules

All planned features

Functional requirements

Dashboard requirements

Selection process

Technology architecture

Demo requirements

The focused features intended for the prototype

Do NOT ignore features because the project is a prototype.

Do NOT replace documented requirements with a generic college website.

Do NOT create only a landing page.

Build a small but highly functional, polished SaaS-style prototype that demonstrates the complete concept described in the documentation.

1. PRODUCT

Application name:

JSPM Group Internal SIH Portal

Short name:

JGI-SIH

Purpose:

A centralized internal platform for managing the JSPM Group's Internal Smart India Hackathon selection process.

The prototype should demonstrate how students can register teams, explore/select SIH problem statements, submit proposals, receive AI-powered analysis and similarity detection, and proceed through faculty review, shortlisting, offline presentation, and final selection.

2. CORE REQUIREMENT

Build a fully interactive prototype, not a static design.

The evaluator should be able to actually click through the major workflow.

The prototype must contain:

Working navigation

Working forms

Working buttons

Working modals/pages

Search

Filters

Tabs

Tables

Cards

Status indicators

Loading states

Success states

Error/empty states

AI-analysis simulations

Charts

Notifications

Chat assistant

Realistic sample data

No important button should silently do nothing.

If a real backend/API is not available, implement realistic local/demo logic.

Structure the application so the demo AI services can later be replaced with real APIs.

3. DESIGN DIRECTION

Create a premium modern SaaS dashboard.

Visual characteristics:

Professional

Clean

Modern

Academic + hackathon oriented

Trustworthy

23. AI ARCHITECTURE READINESS

The prototype should be designed so the demo AI logic can later be replaced with our real AI services.

The project may later connect to:

FastAPI

Python

Sentence Transformers

Embeddings

Similarity models

Gemini/LLM APIs

Vector search

Especially keep these modules modular:

Proposal Analyzer

Similarity Detection

Problem Recommendation

AI Assistant

For now, use realistic local/mock AI behavior so the prototype works immediately.

Do NOT expose fake API keys or require secret credentials.

24. TECHNICAL QUALITY

Use a clean modern frontend architecture.

Prefer:

React

Tailwind CSS

TypeScript where appropriate

Reusable components

Modular pages

Reusable UI components

Clean state management

Local demo data

Avoid unnecessary complexity.

The generated project must run successfully.

Fix compilation/runtime errors before considering the prototype complete.

25. RESPONSIVENESS

Make the application responsive for:

Desktop

Laptop

Tablet

Mobile

Desktop should receive the highest design priority because the prototype will primarily be demonstrated to faculty.

26. IMPORTANT UX REQUIREMENTS

Do not create dead-end screens.

Every major action should produce a visible response.

Examples:

Analyze Proposal
→ Loading
→ Results

Run Similarity
→ Processing
→ Similarity Results

Register Team
→ Validation
→ Success

Submit Proposal
→ Confirmation
→ Status update

Shortlist
→ Status update

Schedule Presentation
→ Confirmation

Publish Result
→ Result becomes visible

Ask AI
→ Chat response

Search
→ Filtered results

27. FINAL QUALITY BAR

The final result should feel like:

A real internal SIH management SaaS platform developed by a professional software team.

It should NOT feel like:

A simple college website

A static Figma mockup

A landing page

A collection of disconnected screens

A generic AI dashboard

It should demonstrate a clear product story:

Problem Submission → AI Evaluation → Similarity Detection → Faculty Review → Shortlisting → Offline Presentation → Final Selection

28. DOCUMENTATION PRIORITY

If anything in this prompt conflicts with the uploaded documentation:

Follow the uploaded documentation first.

Do not remove documented features.

If the documentation contains additional features that are not explicitly listed in this prompt, implement those features as well.

Use the documentation to determine the exact project scope, workflow, user roles, AI modules, technology requirements, and demo features.

29. BUILD ORDER

Build the prototype in this order:

Application shell/navigation

Role-based dashboards

Team registration

Problem explorer

Proposal submission

AI proposal analyzer

Similarity detection

AI recommendations

AI assistant

Faculty review

Shortlisting

Offline presentation

Results

Analytics

Announcements

Final polish and responsive design

After implementation, test the complete demo flow and fix any broken interactions.

FINAL INSTRUCTION

Read the uploaded documentation completely.

Then build the JGI-SIH prototype according to the documentation and the requirements above.

Prioritize:

FUNCTIONALITY > COMPLETE WORKFLOW > AI FEATURE DEMONSTRATION > UI POLISH > DECORATION

The final prototype must be immediately usable for a team demonstration and easy to share with my SIH team members.
